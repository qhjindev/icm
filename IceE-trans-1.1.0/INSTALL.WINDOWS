Requirements
======================================================================


Windows version
---------------

The Ice-E translators have been extensively tested on Windows XP and
Windows 2000.


C++ compiler
------------

The following Microsoft Visual C++ compilers are supported:

- Visual C++ 6.0 SP5 with STLport 4.5 (or later)

- Visual C++ .NET 2003 (aka VC 7.1)

- Visual C++ 2005 (aka VC++ 8.0)

The STL (Standard Template Library) that is included with Visual C++
6.0 is not supported. You must use STLport 4.5 (or later) with Visual
C++ 6.0.

For Visual C++ .NET 2003 and Visual C++ 2005, you can use the included
STL library.


STLport
-------

Ice-E translators require STLport 4.5 or later for Visual C++ 6.0. You
can download STLport at the following location:

http://www.stlport.org/download.html

STLport installation instructions can be found at

http://www.stlport.org/doc/install.html

You must also configure Visual Studio to use STLPort:

- In the Visual C++ 6.0 IDE, choose Tools->Options->Directories

- Select "Include files"

- Add the include directory for STLport first in the list. (Note that
  you must add the "include\stlport" directory, not just "include".)


======================================================================
Compilation
======================================================================

Using your favorite Zip tool, unzip the Ice-E translator archive
anywhere you like, then start the Microsoft Visual C++ IDE.

Open the "icee.dsw" workspace. If you are using Visual C++ .NET 2003
or Visual C++ 2005, you must first convert the project files from
Visual C++ 6.0 to the new solution and project file format.

Set your active project to "icee" to build all of the Ice-E
translator executables. Four build configurations are supported:

  Win32 Release
  Win32 Debug
  Win32 Release Static
  Win32 Debug Static

The first two generate DLLs for the supporting libraries required
by the translators, whereas the last two generate static libraries.
We recommend using a static configuration in order to avoid potential
conflicts with an existing Ice installation.

To set your active project with Visual C++ 6.0, use Project->Set
Active Project. For Visual C++ .NET 2003 and Visual C++ 2005, click on
"icee" in the class view, then use Project->Set as StartUp Project.

To start the compilation, use Build->Build for Visual C++ 6.0, or
Build->Build icee for Visual C++ .NET 2003 or Visual C++ 2005.


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

No automatic installation support is provided; you need to copy the
contents of the bin directory to your preferred location.
